It is a user-friendly, secure application implementing the concept of blockchain to provide students with ease of examination related facilities online and help smoothen the operations of the COEâ€™s office.
We recognized that there were shortcomings in the current system of Examination such as requesting for provisional marks card, transcript and accessing the previous results, question papers and other resources, and hence, wanted to help by solving it. 

STUDENTS:
The students can access and view their previous semester results and current semester results. Students can also view and download question papers of previous internals and examinations effortlessly. A request can also be made to obtain a copy of their provisional marks card and a copy of their transcript.
Data Analysis and visualization is used to generate useful graphs about student performance using matplotlib library from the provided data.

TEACHERS:
Teachers can insert as well as update student marks and upload question papers.

DATABASE ADMINISTRATORS:
Database administrator plays a crucial role in maintaining and ensuring integrity of database. The system provides complete control over the database system. They are allowed to execute required queries on the database. They also have information regarding the various logins by users and their time of logins. They can add details of new teachers and students during admission to the database.

BLOCKCHAIN IMPLEMENTATION:
The principles of Blockchain are used to ensure data security, integrity and consistency. It helps to see to it that the data is not tampered. This is done by adding the attributes of a block in a blockchain to the tables in the database(time_stamp, prev_block_hash, block_hash).
